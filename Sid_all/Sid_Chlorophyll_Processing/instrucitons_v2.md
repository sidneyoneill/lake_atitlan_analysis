# Step-by-Step Instructions for Comparing Sampling and Imputation Effects

This markdown provides detailed instructions for investigating potential sampling and imputation biases between the Surface and Mid-Depth groups.

## 1. Inspect Original Data

### a. Compare Original Chlorophyll Values Before Interpolation or Imputation
1. **Subset the Data**:
   - Ensure you have access to the original chlorophyll values (before interpolation or imputation) in a separate column, such as `Original_Chlorophyll`.

2. **Filter for Surface and Mid-Depth Groups**:
   - Isolate rows corresponding to these depth groups.

3. **Calculate Missing Value Counts**:
   - Count the number of `NaN` values in the `Original_Chlorophyll` column for each depth group.

4. **Compare Missing Values Over Time**:
   - Group the data by `Date` and calculate the proportion of missing values for each depth group.

5. **Plot Trends**:
   - Create a time series plot showing the proportion of missing values for both Surface and Mid-Depth groups.

### Key Questions to Answer:
- Are surface values missing more often than mid-depth values?
- Are there specific periods when the surface layer lacks data?

## 2. Check the Proportion of Imputed Values

### a. Calculate the Proportion of Imputed Values
1. **Create an Indicator for Imputed Values**:
   - Add a new column (e.g., `Is_Imputed`) to flag whether a chlorophyll value was imputed.
     - Set `Is_Imputed = True` if `Original_Chlorophyll` is `NaN` but the final `Chlorophyll` value is not.

2. **Group by Depth Group and Date**:
   - For each date, calculate the proportion of imputed values within the Surface and Mid-Depth groups.

3. **Summarize Across Time**:
   - Aggregate the proportions by depth group to compare overall imputation rates.

4. **Visualize**:
   - Create a bar plot or line chart showing the imputation proportion for each depth group over time.

### Key Questions to Answer:
- Does the Surface group have a higher imputation rate than the Mid-Depth group?
- If so, could this have led to underestimation of chlorophyll concentrations in the Surface group?

## Validation Steps

1. Ensure the missing value and imputation calculations align with expectations.
2. Interpret whether the imputation process might have introduced biases, particularly for the Surface group.
3. Document findings and consider adjustments to imputation methods if biases are identified.

Use these steps to guide your investigation and address potential imputation biases effectively.
